    // Nullable

    // If you see any Question Marks and Exclemation Points in the Kotlin that's
    // Because its Dealing with Nullable

    // Below we are Declaring the Nullable Int Variable by dec Int? to NUll
    var age: Int? = 28

    // Below we Dec age null since we used Nullable Syntax Above as Int?
    age = null


    // To unWrap the Nullable in the Var we can type as Follow so that it will be not nullable
    age!!

    // So below we Created the new Variable called new Numbers and dec the above age variable as Non Nullable
    var newNumb = age 












//    // Below we are Creating the Class Dog
//    class Dog{
//
//    }
//    // Below we Dec the Object for the Class Above and Setting into Nullable
//    var myDawg: Dog? = Dog()
//    // Below we declared the Object Null
//    myDawg = null
